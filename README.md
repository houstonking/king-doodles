# Generalized Constraint-Based Inference

A Clojure library designed to execute various constraint-based inference algorithms over arbitrary semirings. Very WIP; hopefully have the junction tree algorithm done soon.

This work is primarily based on the 2005 thesis by Le Chang from University of British Columbia: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/grads/resources/thesis/May05/Le_Chang.pdf
